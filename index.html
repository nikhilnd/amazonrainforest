        <h2>Climate:</h2>
        <p class="climate-desciption">The climate of tropical rainforests and the Amazon is one of the warmest and most humid of any biome. Ranging from 25-35°C or 75-95°F this weather is part of the natural eco system of the Amazon. Because of this lack in ranging temperature, summer or winter does not exist in the Amazon or any other tropical rain forest.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="precip">
        <h2>Precip:</h2>
        <p class="precip-description">As with the temerature, precipritation in the Amazon and tropical rain forests is also extremley high and the rainforest is also extrempley wet. Ranging from 100-400cm the almost constant rain helps give way do a wide diversity of tree and plants life. In fact, there is so much rain that, much like there is no summer or winter, there is no dry season in the Amazon.</p>

      <ul class="fun-facts">
        <li>10% of the world’s known species live in the Amazon rainforest.</li>
        <li>It is home to around 2 and a half million different insect species as well as over 40000 plant species.</li>
        <li>While the protection of the Amazon rainforest remains an issue, deforestation rates have been reducing while areas of conserved land have been increasing over the last 10 years.</li>
        <li>In both 2005 and 2010 the Amazon rainforest suffered severe droughts that killed off large amounts of vegetation in the worst affected areas.</li>
        <li>A recent study by climate change experts suggests that a 3 °C rise in world temperatures by the year 2010 would destroy around 75% of the Amazon.</li>

        <p class="human-impact-text">Each year, hundreds of acres of the Amazon have been lost to farming, mining, and logging as well as many other human endeavours. A large part of this is deforestation(below) which threatens to wipe out all of earth’s rainforests. Because of all this loss of trees and others natural elements, greenhouse gasses and emissions are also up which are harmful for human life. </p>
